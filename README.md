## Why React and Flask?

Well, for a bit of time I wanted to created an app using both of the frameworks. The lack of in-depth tutorials and examples discourage me to it. But I needed an app to showcase how to add Cypress to a CI/CD pipeline and I had a long weekend a head, so, why not kill two birds with one stone?:D
